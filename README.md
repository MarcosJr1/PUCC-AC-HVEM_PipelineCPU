# The project

A pipeline CPU written in VHDL initially developed to a university project from my course.

# The HVEM Pipeline CPU

Users are able to:

- Perform basic arithmetic operations, like addition, subtraction, etc
- Perform all instructions with immediate values
- Jump or branch to a specific program address

# Install instructions

1. Clone or download zip our project via github, or just go to the releases tab and download the zip</br >
2. With the [Intel Quartus Prime](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite) installed, open the project .qpf file</br >
3. Compile and simulate the CPU</br >

OBS: You are also able to build your own program. We are gonna make a tutorial for it in the future.
